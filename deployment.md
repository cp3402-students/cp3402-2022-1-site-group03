## Project Management
Trello and Discord are our main communication tools used in the management of the project. Discord is used for communication and direct messaging between group members with important application links such as the live website, github, and trello. Trello helps us to share the workload and assign particular tasks to members to ensure everyone understands their role in the project

## Version Control
Version control is used as a way of file sharing between the group with new iterations of wordpress documentation, themes, content, etc.
The Github repository was divided into three branches: Main - every file on record, Export - wordpress content such as posts, media, pages, Theme - wordpress themes and css. Upon any update and new iterations, these files will be commited and pushed to Github to ensure each member has the latest version of the project.

## Testing
Testing of wordpress site is first done on our individual devices through a localhost supported with Xampp. Members will test any code commits to ensure stability before uploading to live site.
