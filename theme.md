-  They also both share a similar background color(#2f4f4f).
# Styles
- Styles can be edited from the style.css file in the document. There are no separate template files called from the functions.php.The individual files are the templates.(check the comments in the codes of individual files to see which code calls the different templates.)
# Pages

Lastly, the pages have a padding of 10% for both the left and right side.
