# Site documentation
---
The live website is hosted through Amazon Web Service on a wordpress supported server. Access to this site is through the URL pasted at the bottom of the document with 
admin usability. Wordpress being a content management system utilises two simple but effective elements in hosting information on screen. Pages are static canvases that either store information directly or host dynamic posts which can be editted instead of editting the page as a whole. Adding either item to the website is simple, first accessing the dashboard which is accessed through the pasted URL and simply clicking either Page or Post listed on the left hand side of the screen. Information that you think will change as the website functions should be placed in Posts instead of pages.
